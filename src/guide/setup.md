# Set up wallet

[Sakura Casino](https://sakura.casino) is deployed in [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (Matic network) for production use; and in [Kovan testnet](https://kovan-testnet.github.io/website/) for testing purposes. If you have the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) extension installed, make sure to [add the Matic mainnet](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-matic) to it.

### Steps to get Metamask ready

2. Get some ETH or DAI in your Ethereum wallet.
3. Configure the Matic mainnet in metamask following [this guide](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-matic).
4. Move funds from Ethereum to Matic using the [Matic bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge)
5. Buy some DAI in [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap).
